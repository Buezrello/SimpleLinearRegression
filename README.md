# SimpleLinearRegression
Python MachineLearning example using Linear Regression

Simple linear regression predicts the output/dependent variable 
based on only one input feature. 

The simple linear regression is given by Linear regression equation

Y = b0 + b1 * X1

b0 - constant or y - intercept of line
b1 - coefficient of input feature
X1 - input feature on which output is based
Y - output
